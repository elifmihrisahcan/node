# Data Structures Console Application

This project implements three classic data structures using singly linked nodes and provides an interactive console menu for performing operations on each structure.

## Stack
Implements LIFO behavior. Supported operations:
push  
pop  
clear  
print  
size

## Queue
Implements FIFO behavior. Supported operations:
enqueue  
dequeue  
clear  
print  
size

## Singly Linked List
Supports indexed insertion and deletion. Operations include:
insert at index  
remove at index  
clear  
print with index labels  
size

## Compilation
Compile with any standard C++ compiler:

g++ main.cpp -o program

Run with:

./program

## Description
The program is fully menu driven. Each data structure runs inside its own loop until you return to the main menu. All structures use dynamically allocated nodes and do not rely on external libraries.
